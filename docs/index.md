# Starting from Scratch: Exception Handling and Pickling
## Introduction
In assignment 7, I was tasked with creating a new program from scratch to demonstrate how exception handling and pickling are used and work in Python. 
## Researching Exception Handling and Pickling:
### Exception Handling:
Here are links for some sites I found that were helpful in understanding exception handling in Python:  
https://python-course.eu/python-tutorial/errors-and-exception-handling.php  
This first site listed did a good job of breaking down the different types of exception handling and providing more technical explanations than were shown in the notes.  
https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/user-defined-exception  
This next site was particularly helpful in clearly showing user defined exceptions and how they should be added to my code.  
### Pickling:  
Here are links for some sites I found that were helpful in understanding pickling in Python:  
https://linuxhint.com/pickle_python/  
This first page was useful in properly implementing a for loop to read all of the data from the pickled file.  
https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/pickle-python-tutorial  
This page had a very in depth but easy to understand list of definitions that were great to really solidify my understanding of basic pickling concepts.  
## Creating the Program:  

### Coming up with ideas:  
First, it will be important to brainstorm some ideas and create a framework for what I want to make. 
My initial thought was to create three separate small programs: One showing exception handling, one showing pickling, and one showing both at the same time. 
However, as I started, I basically ended up creating a program that worked together and just wound up turning it into a larger program like ones that we have worked on before (Code. 1).
```

```
*Code 1: Header and part of the body of the main code*  
  
Essentially my program takes some of the elements of the home inventory program and instead just creates a list of numbers. 
By performing different actions on the list of numbers, I was able to show different examples of both exception handling and pickling in a concise manner.   
### Using Exception Handling:  
I made sure to put examples of exception handling wherever it made sense. 
The first exceptions that are used in the code are an example of raising custom exceptions (Code. 2).
 ```
 class ValueNotNumberError(Exception):
    '''Raised when the value entered is not a number'''
    pass
 ```
*Code. 2: Shows the exception class for when a value entered is not a number.*
This is used in the code used to numbers from the list (Code 3).  
```
    if (strChoice == "1"): # Using append to add values to the list.
        strAdd = input("Please provide a number to add to list: ")
        try:
            if strAdd.isnumeric():
                lstMain.append(strAdd)
            else:
                raise ValueNotNumberError
        except Exception as e:
            print("Please only use the number characters (1-9) for input!")
```
*Code. 3: The code used to append values to the main list*  
  
The exception prevents the user from adding in values that are not 1-9, so they canâ€™t put letters or symbols in the list. 
It raises the custom error if they attempt to do so.  
There is also a value error used if the user tries to remove a value not in the list( Code. 4).  
```
    elif (strChoice == "2"): # Using remove to remove values from the list
        strRemove = input("Number to remove from list: ")
        try:
            lstMain.remove(strRemove)
        except ValueError as e:
            print("This number is not in the list!")
```
*Code. 4: Shows a built in python exception in action.*  
  
The value error exception is one built in to Python so I did not need to do anything other than reference it in the except clause.
I also used the general exception to catch any errors that might occur upon reading the file (Code. 5).  
```
    elif (strChoice == "3"):
        try:
            print("Here is the current list in the file: ")
            objFile = open(strFileName, "rb")
            objFileData = pickle.load(objFile)
            objFile.close()
            for item in objFileData:
                print(item)

        except Exception as e:
            print("There was an error!")
```
*Code. 5: Using a generalized Python exception.*
 
This was mainly included in the case that the user attempted to read the file and it had not yet been created, in which case the program would throw and an error.  
### Using Pickling:  
Picking was much more straightforward for this assignment as I basically used it in a similar fashion to what was shown in the notes (Code. 6). 
```
    elif (strChoice == "3"):
        try:
            print("Here is the current list in the file: ")
            objFile = open(strFileName, "rb")
            objFileData = pickle.load(objFile)
            objFile.close()
            for item in objFileData:
                print(item)

        except Exception as e:
            print("There was an error!")

    elif (strChoice == "4"):
        try:
            objFile = open(strFileName, "wb")
            pickle.dump(lstMain, objFile)
            objFile.close()
            print("Data Saved!")
        except Exception as e:
            print("There was an error!")
```
*Code 6: Reading from and writing to the file using pickling*  
  
Using the load function was a bit tricky as it only loads one thing at a time. However, that object can be a whole list, not just a single string. In this case, since the program saves a list to the file, it can be extracted as a list and printed out using a for loop over the list. This was definitely an interesting interaction that I might not have noticed had I neglected to utilize both ends of pickling. 
## Testing the Script  
### Using PyCharm:  
Since the program was written in PyCharm, it is straightforward to run and test the completed program (Fig. 1).

*Fig. 1:  Testing the program in the PyCharm run window.*  

### Using the Command Window:
After running the script in PyCharm, I made sure to test it using the Command Window on my computer (Fig. 2).

## Summary
I was able to complete this program by utilizing my understanding of both pickling and exception handling, as well as loops and data processing.
